# Semi-HAR
This project is part of my master thesis at NTNU. It's a joint collaboration between SINTEF, NTNU and Hypersension. The object is to create a HAR algorithm that can support blood pressure measurments. The blood pressure measurment device (iNEMO) has no labeled data so therefore we we will create a semi-supervised learning algorithm from exisiting labeled datasets similar to the chest worn IMU that is on the iNEMO. The goal is to use the existing public labeled datasets as a base model and complement it with unlabeled data from the iNEMO.
